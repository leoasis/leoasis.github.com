Well, the title for my first post is kind of mandatory, right? No? Well,
I did it anyway, so... whatever...

I've been wanting to have a blog for some time right now, but I could never
find the time to actually do it. Guess the beginning of the year is a great
moment for starting stuff.

What will you find here? Well, I'm mostly interested in web technology, so
expect a lot from that, but I may post about other things as well. Heck, it's
my blog, so I can do whatever I want!

I also want to thank [@holman][holman_twitter], from which I borrowed this Jekyll theme.
I will start building my own style as time goes by, but this is great ground to
start building up.

So well, this is it, short and sweet! Stay around for some upcoming stuff I have
to share, and, when comments are enabled, give me some feedback! Or, as you
know, you can start giving me feedback through my [twitter account][my_twitter].

See ya!
